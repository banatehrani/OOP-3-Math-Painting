### Object Oriented Programming App 3: Math Painter

- **Description**: This app draws a canvas by asking its dimension 
and color (black or white) from the user. Then it draws rectangles
and squares in different colors on the canvas. The user can 
specify the number of shapes and their colors. This app is used for
the purpose of teaching.

- **Structure**: design.txt includes the class structure of the code
and requirements.txt includes the packages to be installed 
for this project, and they are both in a directory called `files`.
The output canvas image is put in a folder named `output`. 
To run this program, run `main.py` which calls classes from
`canvas.py` and `main.py`.
